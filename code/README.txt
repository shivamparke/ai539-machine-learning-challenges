Name: Shivam
Date: March 20, 2023
Assignment: Final Project
Python Version: 3.10.6
Dependencies: ['numpy==1.24.2', 'pandas==1.5.3', 'matplotlib==3.6.3', 'seaborn==0.12.2', 'missingno==0.5.1', 'scikit-learn==1.2.1', 'tabulate==0.9.0', 'imblearn==0.0']

The dataset is located at: https://community.ibm.com/accelerators/catalog/content/Telco-customer-churn

IMPORTANT: As of 10:35 PM, March 20, 2023, the above URL is generating a garbage output webpage instead of downloading the dataset.
Hence, I am including the dataset in the ZIP file itself as it is very close to 1 MB in size.

You can run the code in PyCharm (Community Edition is free for everyone) or on the command line after installing the dependencies.
Create an empty PyCharm project. Install the libraries above in the virtual environment of the project.
Put all the .py files (total 12 of them) in the project's folder.
Click on "shivam_final_implementation.py" and then run this file.
